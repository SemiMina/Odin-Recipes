    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The recipe for thick pancakes with kefir.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>kefir - 1.5 cup (250 ml)</li>
        <li>wheat flour - 1.5 cups (about 240 g)</li>
        <li>eggs - 1 pcs</li>
        <li>sunflower oil</li>
        <li>sugar - 2-3 tbsp </li>
        <li>salt - 0.5 tsp</li>
        <li>soda - 0.25 tsp</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add sugar and salt to the eggs and beat well with a whisk.</li>
        <li>Then add the kefir. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Put the bowl on a low heat and, stirring, heat the mixture until it becomes slightly warm (to about 40
            degrees). Remove the bowl from the heat.</li>
        <li>Pour into the warm mixture sifted flour in batches, constantly beating with a whisk to avoid lumps. Add
            baking soda.</li>
        <li>Mix everything well. Leave the dough for kefir fritters for about 20-30 minutes. Do not stir the dough
            anymore!</li>
        <li>Heat a frying pan, pour oil (3-5 mm layer). You can use less oil for frying, but the more oil, the stronger
            the fritters will rise.</li>
        <li>Drop the dough into the well heated oil with a tablespoon, gently scooping it from the edge (without
            stirring!).</li>
        <li>Fry the fritters over medium heat on one side at first until browned, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Then turn the pancakes over, cover the pan with a lid and fry on the other side for another 1-2 minutes. You
            can leave the lid on, but the pancakes turn out puffier under the lid.</li>
        <li>Serve kefir pancakes warm, with sour cream, jam or honey.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
